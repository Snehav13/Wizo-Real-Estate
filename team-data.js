    description: "It's commonly preached that the best real estate investment is the one in your backyard. While there is merit to understanding the area in which you're investing, I believe that you're truly limiting your profitability potential by only considering a small geographic area. By considering investments in other states and cities you'll have a large pool of available investments. Exa RealEstate  ultimately gives you better opportunities to Invest across a large geographical area also further diversifies your investments and protects your portfolio against the volatility of local markets."
